Hey you guys!

The program is recompiled, and a
breakpoint is set on the tenth line of the source code. This will stop the
program after the "Hello, world!\n" string has been copied into the str_a
buffer and the pointer variable is set to the beginning of it.

#gdb -q ./pointer   // gdb -q meaning The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a portable debugger that runs on many Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including c

next we get the (gdb) list

the half of the progarm is going to be displayed 

and another half by pressing enter key

(gdb) x/xw pointer
0x7fffffffe260:	0x6c6c6548

When the pointer is examined as a string, itâ€™s apparent that the given
string is there and is located at memory address 0x6c6c6548 in memory, and it contains the address
0x6c6c6548.

similar the other outputs 

(gdb) x/s pointer
0x7fffffffe260:	"Hello World\n"

(gdb) x/xw &pointer
0x7fffffffe288:	0xffffe260

(gdb) print &pointer
$1 = (char **) 0x7fffffffe288

(gdb) print pointer
$2 = 0x7fffffffe260 "Hello World\n"
