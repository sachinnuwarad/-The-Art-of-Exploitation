#cd Desktop
 #perl -e 'print "A" x 20;'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

This command tells Perl to execute the commands found between the
single quotesâ€”in this case, a single command of print "A" x 20; . This com-
mand prints the character A 20 times.
--------------------------------------------------------------
#perl -e 'print "\x41" x 20;'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

In addition, string concatenation can be done in Perl with a period ( . ).
This can be useful when stringing multiple addresses together.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#perl -e 'print "A"x20 . "BCD" . "\x61\x66\x67\x69"x2 . "Z";'

An entire shell command can be executed like a function, returning its
output in place. This is done by surrounding the command with parentheses
and prefixing a dollar sign. Here are two example

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#$(perl -e 'print "uname";')
 Linux

#una$(perl -e 'print "m";')e
 Linux
 
each case, the output of the command found between the parentheses
is substituted for the command, and the command uname is executed. This
exact command-substitution effect can be accomplished with grave accent
marks ( ` , the tilted single quote on the tilde key).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#u`perl -e 'print "na";'`me
Linux
# u$(perl -e 'print "na";')me
Linux
